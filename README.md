# Spring Boot Demos

This project contains a few sample Springboot projects.

1. **MyFirstSbApp**: contains an application based [on this demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA4tfBGY6jY) by [Brian Clozel](https://spring.io/team/bclozel). This demo makes use of several dependencies such as Springboot Web, JPA against a H2 DB, DevTools, Flyway, Actuator, Webjars and Thymeleaf. In a nutshell it delivers an alternative (HTTPS and HTTP/2 based) UI for a Github project using Github's API.

2. **myFirstRestAPI**: contains a REST API based on Reactive Spring based on [this tutorial](https://spring.io/guides/gs/reactive-rest-service/). It makes use of Spring WebFlux.
